## Description

Takes in a word in a Native Language and Translates it, and then shows an image to help association.

TODO: Prettify the page so that it can look like a phone background, set up mobile api to allow it set wallpaper, get a word generator api so that it can automatically generate words (maybe top X words in a language?), maybe include definition of word, allow words to be removed from database
